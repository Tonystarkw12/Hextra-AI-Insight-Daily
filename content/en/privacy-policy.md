## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets collected automatically when you use the Service. 📊

This Usage Data might include stuff like your device's Internet Protocol address (aka IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages you check out on our Service, the date and time of your visit, how much time you spend on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other cool diagnostic data.

When you hit up the Service with your mobile device, we might automatically snag some info, like, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you're rocking, your mobile device's unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also collect info your browser sends our way when you visit our Service or access it via your mobile device. 📲

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We totally use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and store certain info. This cool tracking tech includes beacons, tags, and scripts, all used to collect and track information, plus amp up and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes: 👇

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a small file chilling on your Device. You can tell your browser to straight-up refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't take the Cookies, you might miss out on some parts of our Service. So, unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject 'em, our Service might just use Cookies anyway.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These bad boys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (like checking out how popular a certain section is and verifying system and server integrity).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill on your personal computer or mobile device even when you're offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We totally use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons: 👇

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super crucial for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help authenticate users and stop any shady, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies to give you those services. Period.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about checking if users have accepted the use of cookies on the Website. So, like, 'Did you read the memo?' kinda thing. 😉

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you use the Website, like keeping your login deets or language preferences in mind. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you from having to re-enter your preferences every single time you use the Website. Sweet, right? ✨

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto Your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use Your Personal Data to the extent needed to follow our legal obligations (like, if we gotta hold onto your data to comply with applicable laws), iron out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. No fuss, just facts. ⚖️

The Company will also stash away Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter spell, unless it's used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obliged to hold onto it for longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get transferred to — and kept on — computers outside of your State, Province, Country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might differ from yours. Whoa, cross-border data! 🌐

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're totally giving a thumbs-up to that transfer. 👍

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure Your data is treated securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer Your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of Your data and other personal information. Safety first! 🛡️

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete Your Personal Data or ask us for a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you. It's your data, your call! 🗑️

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service itself.

You can always log into Your Account (if you have one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage Your personal info to update, modify, or delete it. You can also give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

But hey, just a heads-up, we might need to keep certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so. Can't delete everything! 😅

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, Your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before Your Personal Data gets moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. Just keeping you in the loop! 🚀

#### Law enforcement
In some situations, the Company might have to spill Your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency). When the law calls, we answer! 🚨

#### Other legal requirements
The Company might totally reveal Your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is necessary to: 👇

- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect Your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. It's the internet, folks! 😅🔒

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has dropped some Personal Data with us, please get in touch. If we find out we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers ASAP! 🚫👶

If we gotta lean on consent as a legal basis for processing Your info, and Your country demands parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info. Just making sure all our bases are covered.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay savvy! 👀

We've got zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services, and we don't take any responsibility for 'em. Just sayin'.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll totally let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update that "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises here! 🗓️

We totally recommend you peek at this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
