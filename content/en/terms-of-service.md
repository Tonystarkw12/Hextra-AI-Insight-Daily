# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**the Site**" or "**we**"). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service carefully. By accessing or using the Site, you're pretty much saying, "Yep, I agree to these terms!"

## 1. Service Lowdown
**The Site** offers users awesome paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, special resources, e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of our juiciest content is only for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** need to sign up with a valid email address and set a password to snag an account.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all the shenanigans that happen under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing** your account, folks! 🙅‍♀️
*   **The Site** reserves the right to **hit pause or outright terminate** your account if you breach these terms. No messing around!

## 3. Paid Subscription Shenanigans
*   **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, with all fees crystal clear on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** zip through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). FYI, **the Site** doesn't store any of your sensitive payment info. Phew! 🔒
*   **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** – don't forget! – unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **14-Day Refund Policy**: **First-time subscribers**, if you're not totally thrilled with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just ping us at the email below with your refund reason. Remember, it's a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law literally drags us to do it. 💸

## 4. Content Use & IP Scoop
*   **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without a nod from us? That's a big no-no. 🚫
*   **Users** get a cool **non-exclusive, non-transferable pass** to access content for personal learning and reading. Sweet!
*   If you're thinking about **commercial use or quoting extensively**, hit us up to get authorization. We're usually pretty chill.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Uploading, posting, or spreading** any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on someone else's rights is **strictly forbidden**. Seriously, don't do it. 🚫
*   **Trying to bulk download, crawl, or crack** our member-exclusive content using technical wizardry? That's a hard **NO**. We see you! 🕵️‍♀️
*   **The Site** has the right to yank any inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users** faster than you can say "bad behavior."

## 6. Service Rollercoaster
*   **We** totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even yank parts or all of our services whenever we want, without a heads-up. That's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes.
*   If **content becomes temporarily unavailable** because of things we can't control – like an act of God, a server hiccup, or a third-party service crashing – **the Site** will **not be on the hook for compensation**. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer Alert
*   **The info we dish out on the Site** is just for kicks and giggles (well, reference!). It **doesn't count** as any kind of pro advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Don't bet your house on it! 💡
*   **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Law of the Land
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, United States. We're not getting into any conflict of law principles here.
*   **Any disputes** popping up from or related to these terms? Let's try to hash it out nicely first. If we can't, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it friendly, though! 🤝
